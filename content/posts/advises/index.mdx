A pele mele list of advises I would have like to know when i was 18 yo. These work for me, maybe not for you. Just try many things and stick to things that work for you!

- Your energy is your most important resource in life. Aim at always be energetic. If you find yourself have too much down time for no reason in the day. it should be fixed. In particular, aim at eating no sugar in the day.

- Work with objectives. Fix yourself objectives and achieve them. Think deeply about them when it's hard/ remmeber why you are doing this.

- Fix yourself mantras/motivational songs that you can repeat yourself when motivation decreases.

- Be kind, always, with pp. E.g when a coworker does not understand something, he may not have the correct context. Being rude does not bring anything.

- Always be humble, more humble than you think. Being pedant does not bring anything.

- Automation is key. Try to autmoate/fasten your experience in general.

- Nearly everyting, up to a certain extent, is possible with hard work and patience. Some pp won t put the hours/effort. You can put it.

- Stay smily, joyful.

- You have really hard time managing your emotions. Acknoledge it, and try to relativize everything. You handle stress really badly. Stress does not bring anything to you.

- Always say to yourself: What would do the chad that I want to become. try to be the best possible version of yourself. Do you want other pp do see you like a loser or a winner/machine?

- Try to be the best in as much domains as poissible : work, sports, personal, sentimental.

- Continue to see pp. Neither stay in the trap of individual behaviours/ recentrer trop sur soi meme.

- Be disciplined. Explore and try things and STICK to habits that work for you. In particular, morning routine is really important

Commented (TODO): With girls, and in general, self confidency is key. PP say you that you are beautiful, take this change to be a greater machine.

- Dress well.

- Practise sport every day.

- What you eat is really important for everything, starting from energy
