After practising more than 10 years of football during my childhood, I switched to endurance sports at my ~20. These sports bring a lot of learnings and good outomes and i want to reflect back on this in this article. primarily running since it is the one i have the most pushed.

## My practise.

I started cycling around my 20s, at the end of my first engineering school year in Supaero. For running, I had always run a bit to keep form before my 3rd year in Supaero, it s a that time that I started to fix objectives and plan accordingly to them. Before i was just running without clear ideas, and pariticpating in courses without a dedicated preparation. Running is a cool sport because you do need to put so much hours to see true progress and to perfrom (which is the case for biking). Also you just need you pair of backset, and you can practise this sport everywhere in the world!

## My learnings/practical advises

### Running without injury/pain is possible.

This may sound obvious but too much people now run while being injured. If you do something correclty, it should be possible to run, at your maximum, without any injury, or permanent pain.
Even if i say this, you can still have some pain when running, but this does not always mean an injury. I find two criteria good to know if i am injured or not:
I am injured if one of this point is ticked:
- The tomorrow of a session, when waking up and walking, I still feel a pain.
- When running, the pain exceeds (greater or equal) 4/10.
If you happen to be injured, go and see a doctor. It is not harder than this!!


### Be really, really progressive.

Progressiveness is the key not to get injured. I really can t stress that enough. For someone who has never really run or make running in other sports. This person should start by not a too ambitious objective. A 5km is a perfect way to start. Too much people rush into running a marathon for example, and en up injured.
For example, someone who has never run and want to prepare a 5km. The first weeks should be really light, with alternance of walking and running. And the running period per session should not exceed 1km.

Being PATIENT is really important in this sport!

### Prefer frequency over volume

Again, it is far better to run 1 km 7 times a day than running 7 km a day per week. Doing so, you let your body the time to recover/get stronger between each session.

### Training is important, but recovery is still more
You have to eat well, sleep well and avoid too much distractions, such as alcohol, when preparing a course. Obviously, when you do not have any objective you can relax and enjoy your beer. Even when preparing a course, you can also have some time to relax this. Too much pp overthink this and live like a pro player. You can also enjoy social events with your friend by taking a beer. The impact that it haves is really minimal and you gain much more by spending time with your friends!

### Fix an objective, and then sketch a rough schema of a plan.
I find personnaly really important to have an objetive. This helps sutrcutre your training and gives you mental help for hard sessions.
Fix you objective quite early (depends on the distance and the experience of the runner, but a race such as a marathon should be planned 6 months ahead).
I like then to aim for a certain amount of kilometers at peak period. 
A good rule of thumb is that you weekly amount of kilometers should be at least the distacne you re preparing. Ex: you prepare a marathon, you should run at least 40 km per week.
Then aim for a structure like 1 track session per week, 1 hill fractionne in the week. 1 long run in mountains the we. The rest is just footing. 
We are not professionals and we do not need to fix exactly what will happend for all the sessions! We have normal lvies and so we can have imperatives/other things. Sport should not be the top priority!
Do preparatory courses, to try material, see in live what happens.

There are a lot of things common accross the distances, but all these should be tinkered according to your race. For examole, when preparing an ultra trail of 100miles. The last 3 weeks should be really easy because you will need freshness for the race. What we often say if that it s okay to lose a bit of physical fitness in order to retrieve freshness. The trade is winning!


Ex:
I prepared a 72 km, 4300d+ trail running race in 2025.
I registered 6 months in advance.
My preparation lasted ~ 3 months.
I took ~ 3 weeks to increase gradually amount of run km, to achieve 80km a week.
I did 2 preparatory courses. 1 45km 2400d+ 2 months before. 1 ??? TODO 1 month before.
I had 1 track session per week, 1 hill frationne 1 long run.


### Do a personal journaling of your races, before and after the race
Write down your mistakes, what you did good, what you did bad. This makes it to conscientize all this. Before the next races/before planning the next training cycle, feel free to write through all these not to commit the same mistakes!!


## Conclusion

What is amazing is that all these learnings naturally adapt to other fields of our lives. like the professionnal work for example. Not only practising such sports make us keep in fit, but it also brings learnings that naturally infuse in other domains. So what are the reasons not to practise a sport? :D
