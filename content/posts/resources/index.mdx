Here is a curated list of amazing resources I try to follow to stay up-to-date as a ML engineer. There is no need to have a thousand sources of truth, as only few high-quality resources suffice.

## AI

- [AlphaSignal](https://alphasignal.ai/) (newsletter): 5-minute email summary of the latest breakthrough news, models, research, and repos. 
- [TLDR AI](https://tldr.tech/ai) (newsletter): Daily newsletter, provides more news than AlphaSignal and across more fields.
- [Hugging Face spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) (website): The interface to play with the latest sota open source models, from any field.
- [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/@YannicKilcher) (Youtube channel): A funny and competent Youtuber that deep dives into milestone ML papers.

## Tech

- [TLDR](https://tldr.tech/) (newsletter): There are different newsletters (TLDR AI is one of them), and I strongly recommend to opt in for at least TLDR, TLDR AI and TLDR Web Dev.
