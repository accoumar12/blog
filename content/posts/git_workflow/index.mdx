[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is kind of a basic tool for any developer. Over time, I've seen many different workflows and strategies to use git. And I have always found some people struggle and lose time just because of bad habits when using git. It's why i really want to lay out my way of doing things.

I am also really depressed by the quantithy of bad quality advises on git. One that come to my mind is the classical advise to use git stash to temporarily save your work when switching branch. This is a really bad idea, as you will lose track of what you were doing, and stashes are really easy to forget about. I will explain better later what to do instead.


## Use mainly git cli

I see too many pp use visual interface for any command for git, including adding or committing. This is not ideal because 
- Such interfaces sometimes are buggy (cc Sublime Merge).
- They are just a visual way to run git cli commands under the hood.
- You will understand more in depth git by using cli.
- Cli gives you access to more powerful/customized commands. See the next section on aliases for example.

More visual tools are though really helpful in some cases, like for merge conflicts, where i tend to like using vscode interface.
I also really like vscode git graph tool, that comes handy to have a deep look at the git history. for usual or quick lookup, git log is far enough.

## Use terminal aliases to speed up things

Okay, but it is soooo long to write git add , then git commit -m message, everytime. It is much quicker to just use a visual tool!

True, but you should use git aliases. I am personnaly using the zsh git plugin, and i highly recommend using it!

A few ones that I use the most:
`gac` = `f() { git add -A; git commit -m "$1" };f` : Add all changes and commit with message
`gst` = `git status` : Show git status
`gwip` = `git add -A; git rm $(git ls-files --deleted) 2> /dev/null; git commit --no-verify --no-gpg-sign --message "--wip-- [skip ci]"` : The one that I use the most during development, when i need to commit without knowing exactly what i am committing. like for switchinb branch. This is a much better way than using git stash. How much times have you forgot to reapply your stash? Also such a commit with [skip ci] is really useful to avoid triggering CI for such temporary commits. Indeed most CI systems (such as github) recognize this pattern and skip CI for such commits.


## Configure nicely you git with .gitconfig

## Use git worktrees

You should use git worktrees, unless having a really good reason not to. I explained in details why in [this article].

## Do not use stashes for pointing towards code with some meaning

You're developing a new feature but you need to go back working on another branch?
Please do not use a stash, even with a meaningful name. Just use branches. They are made for this.

You're developing 
Stashes are the best way to lose track of any important information

## Adopt a clear branching strategy

I personnaly like the PR based workflow. You have a main branch, and committing directly to it is forbidden. You create feature branches from main, and when the feature is done, you open a PR to merge it back to main. CI runs on each PR to ensure that everything is fine before merging.
Also adopt squash merging, so you do not really care about the history of your feature branch! Also, while each commit on a feature branch does not need to be perfect. The PR should follow the [perfect commit](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/) rules. So each PR should include implementation, tests, documentation, and link to an issue thread, and also you can have a template for this issue thread. I highly recommend using the feature that creates a branch from an issue directly, like on giehub.
