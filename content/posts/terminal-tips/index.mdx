Over the years, I’ve explored many terminal setups, driven by curiosity and inspired by other developers’ workflows. Eventually, I landed on a configuration that just works for me — minimal, efficient, and portable. This post is a jumble of terminal tips that have significantly improved my daily development experience.

## Use zoxide ⚡

[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) is a smarter `cd`. It remembers your most-used directories and allows you to jump between them without typing full paths. I first discovered it through [Dreams of Autonomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aghxkpyRVDY&t=4s), and it’s been a game-changer.

Instead of typing:

```bash
cd ~/projects/work/client-a/sandbox/legacy/scripts
```

You can just type:

```bash
z legacy
```

...and you're there. It removes friction from daily navigation and keeps your hands on the keyboard.

## Use tmux 🪟

This might seem obvious, but **if you're not using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)**, start today. The ability to organize your workflow into persistent sessions and panes is invaluable — especially when working on remote servers or juggling multiple tasks.

## Use a plugin manager for Zsh 🧩

Avoid big, bloated Zsh frameworks like [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) if you only need a few plugins. They often introduce unnecessary overhead and slow down your shell startup.

Instead, go with a lightweight plugin manager like [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit), which gives you full control over what’s loaded — and when. Your terminal will be faster and more predictable.

## Store your config in a dotfiles repo 📁

Switching machines can be painful — unless your config lives in a portable dotfiles setup. I keep all my terminal-related configs (Zsh, tmux, git, aliases, etc.) in a [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/accoumar12/dotfiles).

I use [`stow`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs&t=99s) to manage the symlinks, and I can bootstrap a fresh machine by simply running my [install script](https://github.com/accoumar12/dotfiles/blob/main/setup/install.sh). The setup becomes reproducible and version-controlled.

## Mirror your filesystem structure across machines 🪞

When working across multiple environments (local, server, cloud, etc.), **keeping a consistent directory structure** pays off. It reduces cognitive load and allows you to reuse scripts and workflows seamlessly.

For example, I have a few utility commands (defined in my [`.justfile`](https://github.com/accoumar12/dotfiles/blob/main/.justfile)) that rely on the mirrored structure. One of them, `just sync`, lets me quickly sync code between a server and my local machine. It’s fast, reliable, and avoids configuration drift.

## Setup once, then stop tweaking 🛑

The biggest productivity killer? Constantly switching tools and endlessly tweaking your setup.

Choose your tools with intention. Once you’re happy with your workflow, **stop tinkering and start shipping**. Explore new ideas occasionally, but resist the urge to constantly reinvent your environment. That energy is better spent building things.

## Conclusion 🚀

Your terminal is your cockpit — make it fast, familiar, and dependable. Borrow good ideas from others, but ultimately, build a system that fits your needs. Once you’re there, **trust it, use it, and move on to the real work**.

If you have a favorite terminal tip that’s been a game-changer, I’d love to hear it!
